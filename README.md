### **Project Title:** Diabetes Prediction

### **Introduction**

This project is a Google Colab notebook focused on the task of predicting diabetes. It uses a dataset of patient information to train a model that can predict a diabetes `Outcome` (1 for positive, 0 for negative) based on various health metrics. The notebook is an initial step in a data science workflow, primarily involving data loading, inspection, and likely some form of analysis or model building.

### **Features**

* **Data Handling:** The notebook uses the `pandas` library to read and process data from a CSV file.
* **Data Inspection:** It displays a sample of the dataset, providing a quick look at the features (columns) and the data types.
* **Predictive Modeling (Implied):** The project's name and the data columns (`Outcome`, `insulin prescribed`) suggest that the ultimate goal of the notebook is to build a machine learning model to predict diabetes.

### **Requirements**

* **Google Colab:** This notebook is designed to be run in the Google Colab environment.
* **Python Libraries:** The `pandas` library is required for data manipulation, which is pre-installed in Google Colab.
* **Input Data:** The project requires a CSV file named `diabetics1 (1).csv`. This file should contain a dataset with the following columns:
    * `Pregnancies`
    * `Glucose`
    * `BloodPressure`
    * `SkinThickness`
    * `Insulin`
    * `BMI`
    * `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`
    * `Age`
    * `Outcome`

### **How to Use**

1.  **Open the Notebook:** Open the `Diabetes_prediction.ipynb` file in Google Colab.
2.  **Upload the Dataset:** The notebook includes a file upload widget to upload the `diabetics1 (1).csv` file.
3.  **Run the Cells:** Execute the code cells sequentially. The initial cells will handle data loading and display the dataset to verify that the data has been loaded correctly.
4.  **Further Analysis:** The subsequent steps in the notebook, though not fully detailed in the provided content, would involve data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and the implementation of a machine learning model to perform the diabetes prediction task.
